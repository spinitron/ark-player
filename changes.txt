Maybe try to fix version confusion.


4.2.1 2023 Jun 05

Fixed looping bugs with hls.js v1.4.1 https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/issues/5476
by removing recovery code, instead destroy the Hls player on fatal error.

Add version strings for ark-player and hls.js to user agent.

Fix client error (R2908) in case player UI doesn't exist.

Update station options in demo page dropdown.
