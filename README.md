The Spinitron Ark Player is a widget you can use on a web page. It allows
visitors to play recordings of a radio webcast from Spinitron's Ark
service.

## Demo and instructions

[Combined demo and instructions](https://spinitron.github.io/ark-player/) for web page authors on how to use the widget.

## Use the widget on your web site

You can use the widget on your web site if you comply with these [Terms of Service](https://forum.spinitron.com/t/ark-terms-of-service/277). The
demo page linked above has instructions.

## Access to audio files

If you run the Ark Player on a server of your own and for listeners to access archives managed by Spinitron, ask Spinitron to authorize your origin (CORS) to access the audio files.

## Using the widget as a dependency in your project

If you're using NPM then you can

```
npm install ark-player
```

and import it from there into your project.
